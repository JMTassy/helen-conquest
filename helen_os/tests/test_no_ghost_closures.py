"""
Ghost Closure Detector.

Walks every CLOSURE_RECEIPT_V1 artifact in GOVERNANCE/CLOSURES/ and verifies
each claim: the expected_artifact must exist at the repo-relative path and
hash to the claimed SHA-256 (or satisfy the appropriate directory sentinel).

Fails if:
  - A receipt with verdict == CLOSED has any FAIL or MISSING claim.
  - A receipt with verdict == BLOCKED has all PASS claims (should have been CLOSED).
  - proposer.identity == attestor.identity (Rule 3: no self-validation).
  - An observed hash diverges from expected for any claim.

This is the V4-and-onward enforcement: it makes 'CLOSED' unfalsifiable.
The Schema Authority V1/V2/V3 reports would all have failed this test.
