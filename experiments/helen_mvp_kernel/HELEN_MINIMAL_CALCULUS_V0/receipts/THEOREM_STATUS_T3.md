# HELEN THEOREM STATUS — T3_REPLAY_CONFLUENCE
Date: 2026-08-16 · NON_SOVEREIGN · authority=false · canon=false · ledger_effect=none

SEMANTIC VERSION
  nu = sha256:eff29d80be0091c0   (Lean sources + jurisdiction gate + bounded executor)

FORMAL (Lean 4.33.0, lake build, zero sorry, zero axiom)
  Statement ................. FROZEN
  Definitions ............... PASS   (Step, Admissible, StrongIndependent — C1 folded in)
  replay_append ............. PASS
  replay_adjacent_swap ...... PASS   (the atomic brick; proof stayed short — definitions held)
  confluence_of_swapConnected PASS
  LinExt connectivity ....... OPEN   (explicit hypothesis; trace-theory argument unformalized)
  Global T3 ................. CONDITIONAL (closes when OPEN closes)

OBLIGATIONS ................. MAPPED (7; obligations/T3.yaml)

FALSIFIERS (real kernel: BoundedExecutor + TCB scan)
  hidden_state_probe ........ STATE_DETERMINISTIC=True; receipts deterministic
                              ONLY modulo witnessed ND surface {uuids, *_refs,
                              created_at} — REAL FINDING, feeds nu-canonicalization
  commutator_probe .......... COMMUTE on disjoint pairs; false-independence
                              claim REFUTED as ADMISSION_INSTABILITY (probe works)
  model_identity_probe ...... B_nu_token_level = 0 across 6 TCB components
  hidden-edge search ........ UNWIRED (needs causal-edge annotation on receipts)

COUNTEREXAMPLES
  0 found / obligations O1-O3, O5, O7 exercised; O4 unwired; O6 pattern established

CLAIM
  Confluence-under-swap-connectivity formally follows from the stated
  assumptions (machine-checked). No violation of the mapped, exercised
  obligations observed on the tested corpus.

NOT CLAIMED
  Global T3 unconditionally proved (connectivity OPEN) · implementation
  formally verified · receipt-level byte determinism (explicitly refuted —
  see finding) · anything beyond the tested corpus and this seat.

## T-003 CLOSURE WITNESS (frozen 2026-08-16, exact machine output)

ENVIRONMENT
  lean          = 4.33.0 (leanprover/lean4:v4.33.0, arm64-apple-darwin, commit d8b1897832)
  lake build    = "Build completed successfully (7 jobs)"
  mathlib       = NONE (zero external dependencies — pure core Lean)
  git           = repo HEAD aa315a7; HELEN_MINIMAL_CALCULUS_V0/ is UNTRACKED
                  (freeze witnessed by hash + this record, git-attestable only after COMMIT)

#print axioms (verbatim):
  'HMC.replay_adjacent_swap' does not depend on any axioms
  'HMC.replay_confluence_of_swapConnected' does not depend on any axioms
  'HMC.replay_confluence_of_linExt_connectivity' does not depend on any axioms
  (no sorryAx; not even propext / Classical.choice / Quot.sound)

EXACT SIGNATURES (from #check, verbatim in /tmp/t3_audit.lean run):
  replay_adjacent_swap :
    ∀ {State Receipt} (step) (s₀) (l₁ l₂) (r q),
      (∀ s', replay step s₀ l₁ = some s' → StrongIndependent step s' r q) →
      replay step s₀ (l₁ ++ r :: q :: l₂) = replay step s₀ (l₁ ++ q :: r :: l₂)
  replay_confluence_of_swapConnected :
    SwapConnected step s₀ l₁ l₂ → replay step s₀ l₁ = replay step s₀ l₂
  replay_confluence_of_linExt_connectivity :
    (∀ {l₁ l₂}, LinExt l₁ → LinExt l₂ → SwapConnected step s₀ l₁ l₂) →
    LinExt l₁ → LinExt l₂ → replay step s₀ l₁ = replay step s₀ l₂

T-003 = DONE. Promotion condition met (build ✓, declarations resolve ✓, no sorryAx ✓).

## ND-SURFACE SEMANTIC AUDIT (closes the canonicalization blocker for THIS kernel)

Witnessed by code inspection of bounded_executor_v1.py: no ND field
(decision_id, execution_id, artifact_id, created_at, decision_id_ref,
execution_id_ref, artifact_refs) is ever READ by execute(); receipts are
write-only outputs. The single receipt-derived feedback into future behavior
is execution_identity (registry duplicate-check), computed ONLY from
{tool_type, normalized_target, normalized_payload, pre_state_hash,
policy_version} — all semantic. Classification: ALL 7 ND fields =
OPERATIONAL-BY-CONSTRUCTION for this kernel; stripping them in π_sem is a
justified canonicalization HERE.
SCOPE CAVEAT (upstream suspicion remains valid elsewhere): in any future
ledger-replay kernel where receipts ARE inputs to F, artifact_refs becomes
potentially semantically live and must be re-audited before stripping.

T-004 (LinExt → SwapConnected connectivity): now UNBLOCKED, still OPEN.
No mathlib bridge assumed; project has zero deps — the finite-list bridge
will be built from scratch when its verb arrives.

## T-004 / L3 + L4 CLOSURE WITNESS (frozen 2026-08-16, same session, exact output)

L3 — Hmc/Poset.lean (pure combinatorics: no replay, no HELEN vocabulary)
  pconnected_of_perm_compat :
    (∀ x, ¬prec x x) → l₁.Perm l₂ → Compat prec l₁ → Compat prec l₂ →
    PConnected prec l₁ l₂
  #print axioms (verbatim):
    'HMC.pconnected_of_perm_compat' depends on axioms:
    [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]
  Classification: the three STANDARD Lean classical axioms (introduced by
  by_cases and core List.Perm machinery). NO sorryAx. Per audit discipline:
  recorded verbatim, not naively read as failure.

L4 — Hmc/T3_Global.lean (composition L1/L2 ∘ L3)
  replay_confluence_global :
    irrefl prec → (∀ s r q, Incomp prec r q → StrongIndependent step s r q) →
    l₁.Perm l₂ → Compat prec l₁ → Compat prec l₂ →
    replay step s₀ l₁ = replay step s₀ l₂
  #print axioms (verbatim): [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound] — no sorryAx.

LADDER STATUS AFTER THIS WITNESS
  L0 replay semantics ......... EARNED
  L1 adjacent swap ............ EARNED (zero axioms)
  L2 swap-chain invariance .... EARNED (zero axioms)
  L3 LinExt connectivity ...... EARNED (standard classical axioms, no sorryAx)
  L4 global T3 ................ EARNED — UNIFORM-INDEPENDENCE FORM
     residual OPEN: state-indexed form (independence only at states actually
     reached along the swap chain) — needs reachability tracking through L3's
     induction. Stated in T3_Global.lean header; nothing smuggled.

Proof method (L3): classical bubble argument — head element of one
enumeration is incomparable with everything preceding its occurrence in the
other (forward direction from the other list's Compat, backward direction
from own list's Compat via Perm membership; irreflexivity handles duplicate
occurrences), bubble to front by adjacent incomparable swaps, recurse on
tails via Perm.cons_inv / perm_middle / Pairwise.sublist.

Uncommitted at time of writing: Hmc/Poset.lean, Hmc/T3_Global.lean, this
receipt section, obligations update. Custody pending next COMMIT verb.

## L4′ + O4 CLOSURE WITNESS (frozen 2026-08-16, same session, exact output)

L4′ — Hmc/T3_StateIndexed.lean (state-indexed global T3)
  ReachablyIndependent step s₀ prec ground: independence demanded ONLY at
  states reachable by replaying an order-compatible prefix over the actual
  receipt set, for pairs of that set.
  replay_confluence_global_stateIndexed :
    irrefl → ReachablyIndependent step s₀ prec l₁ → l₁.Perm l₂ →
    Compat l₁ → Compat l₂ → replay s₀ l₁ = replay s₀ l₂
  Soundness rests on two new Poset lemmas: PSwap preserves Perm and Compat —
  hence every state where the swap lemma invokes independence is reached by a
  compatible prefix over ground. L4-uniform is now a corollary
  (reachablyIndependent_of_uniform, zero axioms).
  #print axioms (verbatim):
    replay_confluence_global_stateIndexed: [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]
    swapConnected_of_pconnected_reachable: [propext, Quot.sound]
    Compat.of_pswap:                       [propext, Quot.sound]
    reachablyIndependent_of_uniform:       does not depend on any axioms
  No sorryAx anywhere.

O4 — falsifiers/hidden_causal_edge_probe.py (real kernel: BoundedExecutor)
  Declared poset lives at FIXTURE level — production causal-edge annotation
  decision remains open; nothing sovereign touched.
  Run 2026-08-16, expected_pattern_match = True:
    disjoint_declared_indep  -> COMMUTE            (true declaration survives)
    write_edit_same_target   -> ADMISSION_INSTABILITY 💥 (false decl caught)
    two_analyze              -> COMMUTE
    edits_after_prefix       -> SEMANTIC_NONCOMMUTATION 💥
       ** vacuous at S₀ (both EDITs inadmissible) — ONLY the state-indexed
       test at the reached state refutes the declaration. This is the
       operational witness that independence is state-indexed = L4′. **
    earned_at_reached_state  -> COMMUTE (independence EARNED at reached state,
       undefined at S₀)
  All CAUSAL_MISMATCH outputs are MissingEdge PROPOSALS; no DAG or ledger
  mutated: diagnostic ⊬ DAGMutation.

LADDER: L0-L3 EARNED · L4 EARNED-uniform · L4′ EARNED-state-indexed.
Residual OPEN, named: production causal-edge annotation (operator/MAYOR) ·
kernel-scale antichain sampling on a real ledger once edges exist.
