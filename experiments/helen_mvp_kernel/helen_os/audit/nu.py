"""ν — the execution-exhibit tracer (NU_EXECUTION_EXHIBIT_V1). 🔵 OBSERVED · authority=0.

ν sits UNDER C17: it mints an addressed EXHIBIT of a run's observability, and a pure VerifyCoverage
turns that EXHIBIT into a coverage verdict which C17 then consumes. The canonical chain:

    Execution → typed Events → (D⁺, D⁻, 𝒰) → E_ν → VerifyCoverage → PASS | UNKNOWN | FAIL

with NO reverse shortcuts:
    E_ν ⊬ Π_D=PASS      many events ⊬ stronger evidence      valid structure ⊬ adequate coverage
    Σ (coverage accounting) ≠ Π_D (the verdict)

Three separated objects (Catalogue ≠ Jury):
    a trace says what was VISIBLE · an EXHIBIT says HOW that visibility was produced ·
    a coverage verdict says what that visibility LICENSES.

Anti-circularity: Ω is committed PRE-RUN (omega_pre_hash), so the tracer cannot define success after
seeing its own blind spots. Pessimistic law: d ∉ D⁺ ⊬ d ∈ D⁻ — negative knowledge needs its own
witnessed discovery obligation. sys.addaudithook is only ONE collector, never ν itself; any class
with no defended collector lands in 𝒰. The EXHIBIT cannot even CARRY a verdict coordinate (closed
verdict surface, like WVIS): complete / pi_d_pass / admit / authority / ledger_append ∉ Fields(E_ν).
Determinism: pure functions over injected events; canon reuses the ledger hash_chain.
