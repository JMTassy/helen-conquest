"""Internal transaction integrity — crash-recovery convergence. 🔵 OBSERVED · NON_SOVEREIGN.

E008 (extends E005 write-ahead intent). The kernel question is no longer "was the effect
authorized?" but: after any crash point, can the system converge to ONE unambiguous
governed history? Target:

    Recover(τ) ∈ {NO_COMMIT, ONE_COMMITTED}     never AMBIGUOUS_HALF_STATE

Four distinct propositions — do NOT collapse them:
    P = intent persisted · E = effect observed · R = evidence persisted · C = governed commit
    E ⊬ C · R ⊬ C · C ⇒ R      and      ΔG_governed ≠ 0 ⇒ C

Central discipline (same anti-vacuity law as HAL/κ): status="COMMITTED" ≠ Committed(τ).
Committed is DERIVED from durable facts, never read from the status field. Replay consumes
COMMITTED transitions only, so merely persisting an intent/receipt cannot change history.

SCOPE: internal governed state only. External effects (email/payment) obey ΔW ≠ 0 ⊬ ΔG ≠ 0
and need reconciliation, not this — see the physical-vs-governed distinction. In-memory MVP;
durable fsync WAL is the production substrate (E005 residual, unchanged).
