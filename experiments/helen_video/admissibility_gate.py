"""Admissibility Gate — receipt-required filter between Ralph and delivery.

Rules (in order):
  1. No receipt                     → REJECT
  2. Missing required fields         → REJECT
  3. Receipt binding mismatch        → REJECT  (pipeline_hash ≠ sha256(content_hash+salt))
  4. Continuity score < 0.6         → REJECT  (if prev_clip supplied)
  5. visual_coherence < 0.6         → REJECT  (if present)
  6. temporal_alignment < threshold → REJECT  (if present)
  7. Unknown/absent metrics         → PENDING  (not enough evidence to admit)
  8. All checks pass                → ACCEPT

No fake metrics. An absent metric is never treated as passing.
PENDING means "insufficient evidence" — not deliverable until re-evaluated.

Receipt binding (rule 3) upgrades the gate from policy filter to verifiable
admission system: ACCEPT ⟹ cryptographic binding between content and pipeline.

Ralph cannot call deliver(). Only ACCEPTED ledger entries reach delivery.
