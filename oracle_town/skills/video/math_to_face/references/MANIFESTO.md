# HELEN — MATH → FACE → MATH Manifesto

> **Persistent emotional identity under cheap transformation.**

---

## 1. Core Claim

HELEN is not an avatar generator. HELEN is a **dual-render identity compiler with calibrated invariance tests**, plus a **cost-minimizing transport loop** for emotionally meaningful video editing.

Identity is specified in math, propagated through a typed latent, realized by multiple renderer-specific generators, and verified by renderer-specific embedding gates.

```
m  →  H  →  z_id ⊕ z_control ⊕ z_style ⊕ z_temporal
         →  A_real → G_real → I_real  →  gate_real
         →  A_twin → G_twin → I_twin  →  gate_twin
         →  compose_duo_poster
```

Any claim *"this frame shows HELEN"* is falsifiable by a deterministic gate, not by human judgment.

---

## 2. Emergent Property

**Persistent emotional identity under cheap transformation.**

Once the compiler is wired, the system delivers four guarantees that normally come separately:

1. **Identity preservation** across frames and renderers — HELEN stays HELEN.
2. **Emotional / artistic control** — mood, pose, style are addressable as typed latent slices.
3. **Temporal consistency** — `z_temporal` carries coherence; no redraw per frame.
4. **Cost minimization** — edit meaning, not pixels.

The operational statement:

> A full HELEN video is produced by **transporting a fixed `z_id`** through bounded Δ-perturbations of `z_control`, `z_style`, and `z_temporal` — **not** by re-solving identity from scratch at every frame.

This is **semantic compression of video editing**.

---

## 3. Cost Advantage

### Naïve video generation (current industry baseline)

```
per_frame_cost  ≈  full_identity_synthesis
                +  full_style_synthesis
                +  full_temporal_solve
                +  retry_tax (identity drift → regenerate)
```

Empirically: ~10 Higgsfield credits per 6s clip. 8-shot teaser: ~90 credits. 3-min music clip via new renders: ~400+ credits. Retries add 20-50%.

### HELEN (MATH → FACE → MATH)

```
per_frame_cost  ≈  z_id_fixed
                +  Δz_control
                +  Δz_style
                +  Δz_temporal
                +  gate_check (O(1), zero-credit if local)
```

Empirically (session 2026-04-20):
- 10-shot 1-minute cut: **100 credits** (parallel, calibrated)
- Full-song 3m30s cut: **+10 credits** via recomposition from existing 10 shots (msg 713)
- Future state with MATH→FACE in production: render budget ≈ **local GPU inference**, zero API credits

**Cost collapse mechanism**: identity is a stable anchor, so drift-retries vanish; only the deltas cost compute.

## 4. Proprietary Moat

The defensible innovation is **not any single component**. It's the combination:

| Layer | What commodity systems do | What HELEN's moat adds |
|---|---|---|
| Identity | Prompt / LoRA / reference | `m ∈ M` — structured math object, hashable, versionable |
| Latent | Entangled `R^512` | Typed slices `z_id ⊕ z_control ⊕ z_style ⊕ z_temporal` |
| Render | One generator | Renderer-specific realization maps + adapters |
| Gate | Cosine similarity, human review | Calibrated Mahalanobis with FAR/FRR, per-renderer acceptance regions |
| Refinement | Denoising | φ-resonant SDE with golden-ratio hierarchy and QAM anchor |
| Invertibility | Inversion as afterthought | Round-trip `H⁻¹(E(G(H(m)))) = m` as a contract |
| Transport | Regenerate each frame | Δ-transport on fixed `z_id` |
| Audit | Transcript / screenshot | Manifest per run with hashes, seeds, gate metrics |

The moat is **the loop**, closed at both ends:

```
        ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
        │                                             │
        ▼                                             │
    MATH  ── H ──►  LATENT  ── G ──►  IMAGE ── E ──►  LATENT ── H⁻¹ ── back to MATH
```

Competitors can copy any single arrow. Closing the full loop with calibrated gates and typed latents is what creates the falsifiable-invariance contract — and that's the publishable / defensible claim.

## 5. Technical Equations

```
Canonical pipeline           Face = G(H(m))

Round-trip invariant         H⁻¹(E(G(H(m)))) = m    (up to tolerance)

φ-SDE diffusion schedule     g(t) = γ √(1 − φ^{−2t})          φ = (1+√5)/2

φ-SDE drift                  f(z,t) = −φ^{−t} (z − Π_QAM(z))

Reverse SDE                  dz_t = [f − g² ∇log p_t] dt + g dW̄_t

                             shared ẑ = refine(H(m))

Dual gate (AND)              ACCEPTED = d_real(Emb_real(I_real), μ_real) ≤ τ_real

Δ-transport cost model       per_frame_cost ≈ k_c·‖Δz_control‖ + k_s·‖Δz_style‖ + k_t·‖Δz_temporal‖
                             (k_id = 0 because z_id is anchored)
```

## 6. Product Vision

### Near term (v0.4 — 4 to 6 weeks)

Replace stubs with production backends:
- **REAL**: ArcFace + Flux.1 / SDXL / StyleGAN3
- **TWIN**: Anime-face embedder (or CLIP-face proxy) + Animagine / Pony Diffusion
- Calibrate gates on real reference sets (20+ photos per profile, FAR < 1% target)
- Ship the **cheap 3×3 duo poster** as the first validation artifact

### Mid term (v0.5 — 2 to 3 months)

- Wire `E_real`, `E_twin` inversion encoders → round-trip becomes measurable
- Train learned adapters `A_real`, `A_twin` from paired data
- Activate `z_temporal` slice → coherent 10-second clips from fixed `z_id` + time-varying control
- Run the **One Year of HELEN** falsifiable test (§13 of math_to_face/SKILL.md): full emotion × hairstyle matrix as a video

### Long term (v1.0 — 6+ months)

- **HELEN editor app**: operator picks a clip, dials `z_control` / `z_style` / `z_temporal` via UI sliders, previews changes at O(1) cost, ships when gates green
- **HELEN video library**: a single `mia_helen_dual_v1` anchor backs hundreds of short-form clips (TikTok tier A, partner tier B, festival tier C per §14 signing)
- **Emotional director mode**: feed the Emotions Spectrum plugin as math input → full emotional range rendered consistently
- **Cross-character compiler**: same architecture, different MIAs → multi-character scenes with all identities gate-verified simultaneously

### Revenue / moat framing

Every competitor can render *a* face. Only HELEN can render *HELEN* provably, cheaply, and with emotional steering. That's the differentiator once the pipeline stabilizes — a character you can direct at the latent level, at local-GPU cost, with a mathematical identity contract.

---

## 7. One-line positioning

> HELEN is a low-cost identity compiler for emotionally meaningful video, where mathematical latent control replaces brute-force generative retries — and identity is a contract, not a hope.

---

## 8. One-paragraph abstract

We propose a dual-canonical avatar architecture in which a deterministic identity object is encoded into a typed latent space and realized by multiple renderer-specific generators. Identity preservation is enforced not by visual inspection but by calibrated renderer-specific embedding gates. The resulting system supports controlled style and mood variation while exposing measurable failure modes under identity drift. Because the latent factorizes into identity, control, style, and temporal slices, video editing reduces to bounded Δ-transport on a fixed identity core — trading brute-force per-frame regeneration for semantic compression. This turns avatar cloning from an aesthetic workflow into a falsifiable engineering pipeline with a quantitative cost advantage.

## 9. Status

DOCTRINE as of 2026-04-20. Scaffold implemented in `helen_os/render/math_to_face_starter/` (v0.3.1). Formal specs in `oracle_town/skills/video/math_to_face/` (SKILL.md + references). Promotion to INVARIANT requires: v0.4 real-backend wiring + calibrated gates + a second independent-lane validation + `helen_say.py` receipt binding this document's SHA256 to the ledger + K2 / Rule 3 (proposer ≠ validator).

Cite until then as: *"HELEN MATH → FACE → MATH dual-canonical identity compiler, DOCTRINE calibrated 2026-04-20 session."*
