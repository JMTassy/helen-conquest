# MATH → FACE (HELEN) — Sovereign Rendering Skill

## Positioning (the three canonical lines)

- **Core claim**: HELEN is a **persistent identity compiler**.
- **Emergent property**: **Persistent emotional identity under cheap transformation.**
- **Business value**: **Maximum artistic coherence per credit spent.**

Formal term: **SCVE (Semantic-Compressed Video Editing)**. Full positioning in `references/MANIFESTO.md`.

---

**Class**: Non-sovereign render layer. No kernel authority. No ledger write.

**Position vs helen-director**: helen-director is the **rental** pipeline (Higgsfield Seedance Pro API, closed-box, ~95% identity hold empirically). math_to_face is the **sovereign** pipeline (every component trained + owned + auditable). They coexist. helen-director delivers today; math_to_face delivers long-term ownership.

---

## 1. Canonical spaces + core maps

```
M  Math space      : primes, prime gaps, zeta zeros, fractal params, braid words
Z  Latent space    : R^512 (fixed per HELEN config schema)
I  Image space     : face images / avatars
```

Core mappings (all interfaces defined in `helen_os/render/math_to_face.py`):

| Map | Signature | Status | Scaffold location |
|---|---|---|---|
| **H**   | `M → Z` | stub | `helen_math_to_latent()` — baseline mix with HELEN anchor |
| **G**   | `Z → I` | NotImplementedError | `G_render()` — wire StyleGAN3 / SD / Flux |
| **E**   | `I → Z` | NotImplementedError | `E_invert()` — wire e4e / ReStyle / pSp |
| **H⁻¹** | `Z → M` | NotImplementedError | `H_inverse()` — constrained decoder |

**Canonical composition**: `Face = G(H(m))`
**Round-trip target**: `H⁻¹(E(G(H(m)))) = m`

---

## 2. φ-resonant SDE refinement (stabilizer) — IMPLEMENTED

This is the one layer that's fully scaffolded. φ-resonant diffusion wraps H → G with identity-stabilizing noise/denoise:

**Forward SDE** (data → noise):
```
dz_t = f(z, t) dt + g(t) dW_t
g(t) = γ √(1 − φ^{−2t})
f(z, t) = −φ^{−t} (z − Π_QAM(z))
```

**Reverse SDE** (noise → data, using trained score net):
```
dz_t = [f(z, t) − g(t)² · s_θ(z, t)] dt + g(t) dW̄_t
s_θ(z, t) ≈ ∇_z log p_t(z)
```

Scaffolded in `math_to_face.py`:
- `diffusion_schedule(t, gamma)` — the g(t)
- `phi_drift(z, t)` — the f(z, t)
- `qam_projection(z)` — Π_QAM (stub identity; replace with real QAM projector from MATH RIEMANN framework)
- `PhiScoreNet` — minimal MLP for s_θ (needs DSM training)
- `SDEConfig`, `forward_sde()`, `reverse_sde()` — Euler-Maruyama solver

---

## 3. HELEN Identity Artifact (MIA) — formal object

Formalized in `references/HELEN_MATH_FACE_PROTOCOL.tex` §MIA. Python scaffold at `HelenIdentity` in `math_to_face.py`.

```
MIA_HELEN = (id, D_ref, E_face, μ_e, Σ_e, μ_z, Σ_z, τ_id, τ_rt, V)
```

Components:

| Field | Space | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | str | Stable identifier (e.g. `HELEN/v1`) |
| `D_ref` | `{I_k} ⊂ I` | Curated reference image set |
| `E_face` | `I → E` | Fixed face embedding model (ArcFace recommended) |
| `μ_e, Σ_e` | embedding space | Identity anchor (mean + covariance) |
| `μ_z, Σ_z` | latent space `Z ⊂ R^512` | Generator anchor (mean + covariance) |
| `τ_id` | scalar | Identity gate threshold (Mahalanobis distance) |
| `τ_rt` | scalar | Round-trip drift gate threshold |
| `V` | manifest dict | Hashes, seeds, model versions, config snapshot (reproducibility) |

### Estimators

**Embedding statistics** (identity anchor):
```
e_k = E_face(I_k)
μ_e = (1/N) Σ e_k
Σ_e = (1/(N-1)) Σ (e_k − μ_e)(e_k − μ_e)^T
```

**Latent statistics** (generator anchor):
```
z_k = E(I_k)    (via inversion encoder)
μ_z = (1/N) Σ z_k
Σ_z = (1/(N-1)) Σ (z_k − μ_z)(z_k − μ_z)^T
```

### Operational gates (PASS/FAIL, all deterministic)

| Gate | Definition | Scaffold function |
|---|---|---|
| **Identity (Mahalanobis)** | `D_id(Î) = √((ê − μ_e)^T Σ_e⁻¹ (ê − μ_e)) ≤ τ_id` | `passes_identity_gate()` |
| **Round-trip** | `‖ẑ − z₀‖₂ ≤ τ_rt` where `z₀ = H(m)`, `ẑ = E(G(z₀))` | `passes_roundtrip_gate()` |
| **Visual consistency (LPIPS)** | `LPIPS(G(z), G'(z)) ≤ τ_vis` | `passes_visual_consistency_gate()` |
| **Math attribution** | `H⁻¹(E(G(H(m)))) = m` | stubbed in `round_trip_invariants()` |

### MVP simplification

For small N or early development, set `Σ_e ≈ σ² I` (diagonal/isotropic) via `sigma_e_diag`. Upgrade to full covariance when reference set diversity makes it meaningful.

### Empirical precursor

HELEN_CHARACTER_V2 §2 T3 method (single-photo Seedance seed, ~95% operator-rated identity hold). The MIA formalizes this as averaged anchors + **mathematically measurable** Mahalanobis gate (rather than operator-rated emotional reaction).

---

## 4. Gates (identity preservation + round-trip invariants)

Per Phase 0.2 — the assistant must be **gated, not creative**. Three gate functions stubbed in the scaffold:

| Gate | Definition | Pass condition | Scaffold |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Identity distance** | `1 − cos(ArcFace(face), anchor)` | `< δ_id` (default 0.35) | `passes_identity_gate()` |
| **Latent drift** | `‖z₁ − z₂‖` after m→z→I→z | `< ε` | stubbed in `round_trip_invariants()` |
| **Visual consistency** | `LPIPS(G(z), G'(z))` | `< δ` | stubbed |
| **Math attribution** | `H⁻¹(E(G(H(m)))) ≡ m` | equality | stubbed |
| **IP functional** | `sup_{d_M(m₁,m₂)<δ} ‖G(H(m₁)) − G(H(m₂))‖` | `< ε_preserved` | `identity_preservation_functional()` |

All gate thresholds and pass/fail verdicts become part of the per-run **manifest** (Phase 7.2).

---

## 5. MVP pipeline commands (Phase 7.1 intent router)

Four top-level commands, scaffolded in `math_to_face.py`:

| Command | Input | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `math_to_face_helen(m, helen, score_net, cfg)` | math vector `m` + HELEN identity | image + latent + logs |
| `face_to_math(image)` | face image | recovered math object `m` + confidence |
| `validate_roundtrip(m, ...)` | math object | gate report (drift, LPIPS, attribution) |
| `record_identity(face_images, arcface)` | N reference photos | `HelenIdentity` object |

All four return (or should return, when wired) a **manifest** containing: config hash, model versions, input hash, latents (z₀, zT, ẑ₀), gate metrics, pass/fail.

---

## 6. Build plan — Phase 0 → Phase 9 roadmap

From the operator's deep build plan (2026-04-20 session):

### Phase 0 — Non-negotiables (locked before coding)
- Canonical spaces + contracts (M, Z⊂R^512, I) — **DONE** (this doc + scaffold)
- Gates (identity / LPIPS / attribution) — **INTERFACE DEFINED** (stubs)

### Phase 1 — Repo skeleton (1 day)
Operator-proposed layout (`helen-assistant/src/...`) is deferred — current scaffold consolidates Phase 1 in the single file `helen_os/render/math_to_face.py`. Future refactor: split into `src/helen/identity.py`, `src/math/encoder_H.py`, `src/qam/projection.py`, `src/sde/phi_sde.py`, `src/score/phi_score_net.py`, `src/generator/G.py`, `src/pipeline/math_to_face.py`.

### Phase 2 — Identity anchoring (1-2 days)
- HELEN Identity Artifact dataclass — **DONE** (stub)
- ArcFace embedding pipeline (preprocess → detect → align → embed → store) — **PENDING** (wire insightface)
- Mean + covariance anchors — **PENDING**

### Phase 3 — H and H⁻¹ (1-2 weeks)
- Canonical math struct (primes, gaps, zeta zeros, fractal dim, braid word) — **PENDING**
- H baseline (handcrafted Fourier features + φ-reg) — **PARTIAL** (`helen_math_to_latent` is stub mix)
- H learned (Transformer/MLP) — **PENDING** (needs training data)
- H⁻¹ constrained decoder — **PENDING**
- Training pairs strategy: synthetic / real-faces-via-E / hybrid — **OPEN QUESTION**

### Phase 4 — G + E (1-2 weeks)

- E baseline (e4e / ReStyle pretrained) — **PENDING**

### Phase 5 — φ-SDE refinement (3-10 days)
- Forward SDE — **DONE** (`forward_sde()`)
- Reverse SDE — **DONE** (`reverse_sde()`)
- Π_QAM decision (identity / low-rank / HELEN-anchor projector) — **PENDING**
- Score net training (DSM loop) — **PENDING** (model defined, loop not)
- Wire into generation: m → H → forward_sde → reverse_sde → G — **INTERFACE DONE** (needs G + H wired)

### Phase 6 — QΦ-SoftPrompt (optional, 3-7 days)
- Prime-mask prompt utility — **PENDING**
- Hamiltonian edit (additive or unitary-inspired) — **PENDING**
- Use case: "HELEN, same identity, change only hairstyle/lighting/pose"

### Phase 7 — Assistant layer (3-10 days)
- Intent router → 5 tools — **INTERFACE DEFINED** (scaffold stubs)
- Manifest logging contract — **PENDING** (spec in §7.2)

### Phase 8 — Verification protocol (ongoing)
- Unit tests: `E(G(z)) ≈ z`, `H⁻¹(H(m)) ≈ m`, SDE stability — **PENDING**
- Acceptance tests: identity ≥ threshold, LPIPS ≤ threshold, round-trip success rate — **PENDING**

### Phase 9 — Deployment (when local works)
- GPU inference service (G, E, score net) — **PENDING**
- CPU service (routing + logging) — **PENDING**
- Artifact store (identity objects + manifests) — **PENDING**

---

## 7. Config schema (Phase 1.2 — `configs/helen.json` equivalent)

Defined inline in scaffold via `SDEConfig`. Canonical values per HELEN config schema:
- `latent_dim`: 512 (fixed)
- `phi_regularization`: true
- `face_embedding_model`: `insightface/arcface_resnet50`
- Default SDE: `gamma=0.10`, `steps=200`, `t ∈ [0, 1]`

---

## 8. Interaction with helen-director (the rental pipeline)

Two pipelines, one repo, different purposes:

| Question | helen-director (today) | math_to_face (long-term) |
|---|---|---|
| Identity preservation | ~95% empirical (operator-rated) | ArcFace cosine-distance gate, mathematically measurable |
| Cost per 6s clip | ~10 Higgsfield credits | GPU inference only (owned hardware) |
| Latency | ~2-5 min/clip API wait | TBD after Phase 4 (G speed dependent) |
| Control over mapping | None (API black box) | Full (every layer trainable/tunable) |
| Math-conditioned | No | Yes (the point) |
| Round-trip `face → math → face` | Not possible | Yes (E then H⁻¹ then H then G) |
| Readiness | PRODUCTION (msg 708, 711, 712, 713) | SCAFFOLD |

**Interim**: use helen-director for deliverables. Route research-grade rendering experiments through math_to_face as components come online.

---

## 9. Integration with Emotions Spectrum plugin

The operator's `#pluginEmotionsSpectrum.pdf` defines 100+ structured emotions (Vibrant Serenity, Curious Joy, Transcendent Awe, Ethereal Melancholy, etc.). These become valid inputs to the math encoder H:

```python
emotion_vec = encode_emotion_taxonomy(emotion_name)  # future: M-space embedding
face = math_to_face_helen(emotion_vec, helen, score_net, cfg)
```

This is the "MATH → FACE" semantic loop: emotion (math-typed) → HELEN's rendered expression. Operator's vision from today's session.

---

## 10. Governance notes

- All files under `helen_os/render/**` are non-sovereign per `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` firewall. Writes to the render layer do not touch kernel, governance, schemas, ledger, mayor, or closures.
- Training data + model weights should live in `artifacts/` (non-firewalled) or `/tmp/helen_temple/` during dev.
- Trained checkpoints must ship with their own `.provenance.json` (model hash, training data hash, training run id) before being cited in any claim — K8 extension to the render layer.
- Per `NO RECEIPT = NO CLAIM`: no rendered face counts as "HELEN" until an identity gate (§4) has run and passed, with the resulting metrics receipted via `helen_say.py`.

---

## 11. Admission status

**DOCTRINE scaffold** — interfaces + SDE core landed 2026-04-20. The document itself is not INVARIANT. Promotion gates:

- At least H + G wired end-to-end producing an image that passes the identity gate on HELEN's anchor
- `helen_say.py` receipt binding this document's SHA256 to the ledger
- K2 / Rule 3: the session that promotes must not be the session that authored
- Second fresh-lane reproduction of the SDE forward/reverse round-trip on synthetic data

Until then: cite as "sovereign rendering scaffold per 2026-04-20 session — interfaces defined, backends not wired."

---

## 12. Cross-references

- `helen_os/render/math_to_face.py` — the scaffold module (single file, all interfaces)
- `oracle_town/skills/video/helen-director/SKILL.md` — peer skill (Seedance rental pipeline)
- `oracle_town/skills/video/helen-director/HELEN_CHARACTER_V2.md` — T3 photo-seed empirical precursor

- `/Users/jean-marietassy/Desktop/#pluginHELEN 20 avril 26.pdf` — MATH RIEMANN / QAM framework (source for Π_QAM projector)

---

## 13. Video falsifiable test protocol — "One Year of HELEN"

End-to-end experiment that proves (or falsifies) that MATH → FACE holds identity across the full emotion × hairstyle matrix, tested as a video. Must run AFTER H / G / E / H⁻¹ are wired (Phases 3-4); this section is the contract the assistant will execute once backends exist.

### 13.1 Test suite axes

- **Emotions** `E = {neutral, joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust}` (minimal Ekman-7; expand later to Emotions Spectrum 100+).
- **Hairstyles** `H = {bob, long, ponytail, bangs, wet, straight, curly, updo, …}` (8+ styles).
- **Timeline**: T timestamps (`T = 365` days or `T = 52` weeks). Each timestamp `t` has `c_t = (emotion_t, hair_t)`.
- **Optional later axes**: lighting, outfits. Don't add until emotion × hair stabilizes.

### 13.2 Two valid production modes

**Mode A — strict Math → Face per frame**:
```
z_{0,t} = H(m_t)
ẑ_{0,t} = Refine_φ(z_{0,t}; c_t)    # φ-SDE forward/reverse
I_t     = G(ẑ_{0,t})
```
Round-trip gate must pass: `H⁻¹(E(G(H(m_t)))) = m_t`.

**Mode B — Face → Math → Face continuity** (recommended for video):
```
z_t     = E(I_{t-1})
z'_t    = Edit(z_t; c_t)            # QΦ-SoftPrompt or learned edit
I_t     = G(Refine_φ(z'_t))
```
Previous frame is the identity anchor → better temporal continuity.

### 13.3 Control signals per axis

**Emotion**: facial action coding (AU targets) OR emotion classifier on output images as feedback signal.
**Hairstyle**: segmentation mask / hair attributes OR CLIP-like text-image embedding scoring ("short bob haircut").

These are **condition signals**, separate from the identity signal.

### 13.4 Per-frame gates (all must PASS for frame ACCEPTED)

| Gate | Definition | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| **Identity (Mahalanobis)** | `D_id(I_t) = √((ê_t − μ_e)^T Σ_e⁻¹ (ê_t − μ_e)) ≤ τ_id` | per-MIA `tau_id` |
| **Round-trip (Mode A only)** | `‖E(I_t) − H(m_t)‖ ≤ ε` AND `H⁻¹(E(I_t)) ≈ m_t` | per-MIA `tau_rt` |
| **Temporal consistency** | `LPIPS(I_t, I_{t-1}) ≤ τ_temp` — EXCEPT at intentional jump cuts (e.g., hairstyle transitions) | `tau_temp` ≈ 0.25 |
| **Emotion condition** | `S_emo(t) ≥ τ_emo` | `tau_emo` ≈ 0.7 |
| **Hair condition** | `S_hair(t) ≥ τ_hair` | `tau_hair` ≈ 0.7 |

Frame accepted iff product of indicator variables = 1. On FAIL: regenerate with adjusted SDE steps / edit magnitude / re-seed; up to `K = 3` retries per frame.

### 13.5 Build algorithm

```
for t in 1..T:
    # Anchor from previous frame (Mode B)
    z_{t-1} = E(I_{t-1})
    # Apply edit: hair + emotion → z'_t
    z'_t = Edit(z_{t-1}, c_t)
    # φ-SDE refinement (reverse SDE with score net)
    ẑ_t = reverse_sde(z'_t, cfg, score_net)
    # Render
    I_t = G(ẑ_t)
    # Gate
    if not all_gates_pass(I_t, I_{t-1}, c_t, helen):
        retry up to K times with adjustments
        if still fails: mark frame FAILED, log reason
    # Log
    append manifest entry
```

### 13.6 Manifest per frame (mandatory logging contract)

Every frame MUST log:
- Input condition `c_t` (emotion name, hair name)
- Latents `z_{t-1}, z'_t, ẑ_t` (hashes if too large to store raw)
- Identity distance `D_id(t)`
- `LPIPS(I_t, I_{t-1})`
- Emotion score, hair score
- Retry count, final verdict (ACCEPTED / FAILED with reason)
- Seeds, model versions, config snapshot (`latent_dim=512`, `φ_regularization` flag, etc.)
- `helen_say.py` receipt ID if this frame is promoted to canon

This makes the test **reproducible** and **falsifiable** — not vibes.

### 13.7 Output artifacts

- **Final montage video** — "One Year of HELEN" sequence (accepted frames in order, with planned jump cuts)
- **QC dashboard** — identity-distance / hair-score / emotion-score time series plots; failure rate per (emotion, hair) cell
- **Failure reel** — only failed frames with gate-failure reasons (critical for debugging drift hotspots like "ponytail + fear")

### 13.8 Gates that failure reveals

Running this test across all (emotion, hair) cells reveals:
- Which combinations destabilize identity (drift hotspots)
- Whether φ-SDE step count / γ need per-axis tuning
- Whether certain emotions need pre-anchor warm-up (e.g., fear might need a lower edit magnitude than joy)
- Whether the generator G has blind spots (e.g., certain hair styles unsupported)

Failures are data. The test isn't "pass everywhere" — it's "produce a calibrated failure map that tells us where the stack is weak."

### 13.9 Prerequisites (what must exist before running this test)

- [ ] MIA estimated for HELEN (μ_e, Σ_e, μ_z, Σ_z populated from reference set)
- [ ] G wired (StyleGAN3 / SD / Flux — decision pending)
- [ ] E wired (e4e / ReStyle — baseline choice)
- [ ] H baseline (handcrafted Fourier + φ-reg OR learned encoder)
- [ ] Score network trained via DSM on clean latents
- [ ] Π_QAM decision made (identity / low-rank / HELEN-anchor projector)
- [ ] Emotion classifier + hair scorer wired for condition gates
- [ ] Manifest logging infrastructure (JSON append-only + model-version registry)

This test is explicitly **NOT** a session-scope deliverable. It's a multi-week integration milestone that validates the whole stack end-to-end once Phase 4 + Phase 5 are complete.

---

## 14. Dual-canonical HELEN — REAL + TWIN

Doctrine extension shipped 2026-04-20 (operator direction): HELEN has **two canonical render profiles sharing one math identity**. Enables paired rendering (HELEN and her digital twin in the same scene).

### 14.1 Architecture contract

```
ONE shared math identity  :  helen_math_id  (invariant, shared by both)
TWO render profiles       :
    Profile A (REAL)  : photorealistic HELEN      → ArcFace anchor
    Profile B (TWIN)  : manga/anime HELEN         → anime-face / CLIP-face anchor
ONE paired render operator:  (I_real, I_twin) = (G_real(R_real(z,c)), G_manga(R_manga(z,c)))
                              where z = H(m) and c are scene conditions
```

**Key invariant**: both profiles come from the same `z = H(m)`. That's what makes them "the same person" across modalities — not matching prompts, but matching latent anchor.

Python scaffold: `HelenDualIdentity` dataclass + `paired_render()` function in `helen_os/render/math_to_face.py`.

### 14.2 HelenDualIdentity components

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `shared_math_id` | e.g. `"HELEN/v1"` — the invariant both profiles must agree on |
| `real: HelenIdentity` | full MIA for the photorealistic profile (μ_e, Σ_e via ArcFace) |
| `twin: HelenIdentity` | full MIA for the manga/anime profile (μ_e, Σ_e via anime-face or CLIP) |
| `paired_scene_templates` | named reusable scenes like `"HELEN_OS_METAVERSE_DUO"`, `"CONTROL_ROOM_DIALOGUE"` |

### 14.3 Paired identity gates

Both profiles gate independently. Paired render is ACCEPTED only if **both pass their own anchor**:

```
real_pass = passes_identity_gate(I_real, dual.real, arcface_real_model)
twin_pass = passes_identity_gate(I_twin, dual.twin, arcface_twin_model)
accepted  = real_pass AND twin_pass
```

- `arcface_real_model` — ArcFace ResNet50 or equivalent photoreal face embedder
- `arcface_twin_model` — anime-face embedder (e.g., ANIMEFACE models) OR CLIP-face proxy for stylized identity

### 14.4 Use-case commands the assistant supports

Once wired, the assistant handles:
- `"Generate HELEN + twin in scene X"` → paired_render with scene template
- `"9 moods for both, same timeline"` → matrix over emotion axis, paired per cell
- `"Switch control: twin speaks, real reacts"` → two-character dialogue with coupled expressions per frame
- `"Cross-modal continuity check"` → run gates on both profiles, assert co-pass rate ≥ threshold

### 14.5 Paired scene template — `HELEN_OS_METAVERSE_DUO`

Reference prompt saved at `references/DUO_POSTER_PROMPT.md`. Summary:

- **Setting**: neon cyber corridor / metaverse control room, holographic circuitry, teal + purple glow
- **Left**: HELEN_REAL — photorealistic, white fitted "HELEN" tank, orange/blue shorts
- **Right**: HELEN_TWIN — anime/manga version, black "HELEN OS" hoodie, matching hair+eyes+freckles
- **Center**: large holographic android silhouette with "HELEN OS" chest text
- **Bottom**: caption strip "inside HELEN OS METAVERSE"
- **Critical**: identity pairing must be obvious — same person in two render modes

### 14.6 Extension to the One-Year-of-HELEN test (§13)

The video test protocol extends naturally to dual-canonical. Each frame becomes a pair:

```
for t in 1..T:
    (I_real_t, I_twin_t) = paired_render(m_t, c_t, dual, ...)
    frame_accepted = (identity_real_pass AND identity_twin_pass
                      AND temporal_real_pass AND temporal_twin_pass
                      AND emotion_pass AND hair_pass)
```

Both profiles subject to their own temporal consistency gate. Optionally add a **cross-modal identity coherence gate**: does HELEN_REAL at time t look like "the same person" as HELEN_TWIN at time t under cross-embedding? This is the hardest gate and unlocks true dual-canonical.

### 14.7 Budget implications

Paired render doubles Higgsfield credit cost per frame (one real + one twin) — if using helen-director rental for prototyping. For the sovereign math_to_face pipeline, cost is two G forward passes (local compute). Test suites using §13 protocol with dual-canonical should expect 2× the frame budget.

### 14.8 Status

DOCTRINE (scaffold). `HelenDualIdentity` + `paired_render()` interfaces landed 2026-04-20. Backends (G_real, G_manga, anime-face embedder) pending Phase 4 wiring. First validation target: single paired-render still image (the duo poster) before extending to video.
