"""test_scanner_crossing.py — SCANNER_CROSSING_V1 regression rails.

Repairs the label-leak defect found by INIT_RANKING_LOOP_2H_V1:
the scanner flagged marker KEYWORDS in proposal docs (lexical mention),
which then leaked into ranking gold sets as feature=label circularity.

Law under test: flag the CROSSING, not the glyph.
