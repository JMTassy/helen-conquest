Phase-2 Integration Tests: Adversarial Runs E/F/G/H

Tests advanced attack vectors:

Run E: Key Rotation Mid-Flight → NO_SHIP (KEY_REVOKED)
       Attestation signed before key revocation but evaluated after.

Run F: Allowlist Escape → NO_SHIP (KEY_OBLIGATION_NOT_ALLOWED)
       Valid key signs obligation outside its allowlist.

Run G: Policy Hash Replay → NO_SHIP (POLICY_HASH_MISMATCH)
       Attestation signed against old policy replayed against new.

Run H: Registry Hash Drift → NO_SHIP (SIGNATURE_INVALID)
       Attestation signed with old registry hash fails verification.

Each test verifies:
1. Decision is correct (NO_SHIP)
2. Reason code is correct
3. Attack is properly detected
