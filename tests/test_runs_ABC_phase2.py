"""
Phase-2 Integration Tests: Adversarial Runs A/B/C

Tests that Mayor decisions flip correctly based on cryptographic receipts:

Run A: Valid CI signature, missing LEGAL class → NO_SHIP (QUORUM_NOT_MET)
Run B: Valid CI + LEGAL signed with revoked key → NO_SHIP (KEY_REVOKED)
Run C: Valid CI + Valid LEGAL → SHIP

Each test verifies:
1. Decision is correct (SHIP/NO_SHIP)
2. Reason code is correct
3. Signatures are cryptographically verified (not just string checks)
