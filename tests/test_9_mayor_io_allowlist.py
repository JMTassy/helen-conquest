Constitutional Test 9: Mayor I/O Allowlist

This test enforces that Mayor cannot read UI/Creative/District artifacts
by file I/O, even if they exist on disk.

Test Strategy:
1. AST-scan Mayor source for open() calls
2. Check that any paths opened match allowlist
3. Check that source doesn't contain forbidden hint tokens

Receipt Value:
- Closes loophole: AST import check prevents `import creative`, but
  this prevents `open("ui_event_stream.json")` backdoors
- Enforces "Mayor reads only briefcase + ledger" at I/O level
- Complements test_3 (import purity) with I/O purity

Note:
The strictest enforcement is: Mayor accepts only in-memory objects
(briefcase, attestations, kill_switch_signals) and NEVER opens files.
If your architecture requires Mayor to read ledger by path, add that
path to ALLOWED_OPEN_PREFIXES. Otherwise, set it to empty tuple.
